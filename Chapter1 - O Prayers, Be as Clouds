*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

——The final hours were calm, passing surprisingly quietly.

???: [——Mine Star.]

Indeed, the tone of that voice was flat, yet its call held an uncontainable degree of love, so Yorna’s long eyelashes trembled, as she looked up at the man beside her.

It was just an ordinary voice, in this miraculous tryst it felt like it had called out to her hundreds, thousands, of times—— And yet, in this moment it felt special.

——No, to be precise every single calling was special when removed from its moment in time. However, the specialness of this moment certainly differed from those other special moments.  

The miracle of something like this time, the meaning contained within that call indicated that it had come to an end.

Yorna: [Yes, Your Excellency.]

She gazed back at the eyes looking at her, and from her own lips was returned a calling filled with her love.

Her voice did not quiver, and she praised herself for not letting her feminine feelings make her collapse. In the moment of their previous parting, Iris=Yorna had been unable to leave him any words. But, during the various periods of her reincarnations where she had looked back at that moment, she had thought countless times about if she were to receive another chance.

If she ever had the chance, she would absolutely not leave behind the wailings of a weak woman.

Eugard: [‘Tis the inverse of that time. Mineself shall be passing on before you.]

Yorna: [That’s right… Revenge, I’m sure that Your Excellency has learned about this evil in the human world.]

Eugard: [Verily. I learned much… Nay, I was taught. From you who was alongside mineself from the beginning, and the many others that walked alongside mineself.]

Yorna: [————]

Those piercing eyes narrowed as he—— as Eugard Vollachia as he was in the past reminisced upon the people that he had met, the gentle wavering of his brilliant eyes causing a prickle in Yorna’s chest.

Always, except for when he was in front of Iris he had been a person that wore a stern expression. 

Because he was such a person, after Iris had ceased to be, she had wondered if he had been able to even once relax his cheeks, or his eyebrows.

And from now, as he went towards that place between the heavens and the earth, he——.

Eugard: [Be not afraid, Mine Star. I, was an unexpectedly blessed man.]

Yorna: [——Ah.]

Eugard: [I met you, and received new life. I walked with you, and received your blessings. I parted from you, and made an error, but now that fortunes sought to bring us together once more I have received an opportunity to rectify mine mistake.]

Eugard’s words, the lovely voice of a person counting their blessings one-by-one, gently dissolved the anxiety and fears within Iris=Yorna’s heart, lovingly unraveling them.

Since antiquity, since he had lost his dearest Iris, Eugard’s hatred left him with burning rage, becoming the trigger for countless tragedies due to a faulty law—— That, Eugard’s descendent, the current Emperor of Vollachia who called himself the Wise Emperor, had promised to abolish that law.

To lift the curse which bound the wolfpeople and molepeople, such was the dearest wish of Iris=Yorna, and Eugard’s final regret when he had been alive—— Finally, they could return this world to those that were qualified to live in this era.

To that end——,

Eugard: [For you Mine Star, it is the same.]

Suddenly, as he took her into his arms, Eugard’s words caused iris=Yorna’s breath to stop. It was like the emotions inside of her had been properly, and more precisely than ever before, been cut into.

Yorna: [Your Excellency… I… I]

Eugard: [Even if it was given to you in a form which you did not desire, no matter what time that you found yourself in, it is easy to imagine that you earnestly formed bonds with others as ages passed. Of course, the same is true for you in your present form—— That, is something you must fulfill to your utmost.]

Towards Iris=Yorna, she who had lost herself in the unnatural existence of her own body, this was a kind choice that was made so she could continue towards an easier to understand existence.

Eugard, was always correct.

Because Eugard was wise, or strong, was not the reason. It was because he thought sincerely about those that he faced, with reverence, because he was a compassionate Emperor who wished for the happiness of others.

The man called the King of Thorns, he who was feared but was Iris=Yorna’s dear Emperor, who held an unbearable amount of deep love, who thought sincerely about Iris=Yorna, with reverence, he prayed.

And so, Eugard’s words were always correct to Iris=Yorna.

And so, the fact that this was true for everyone except Iris=Yorna——,

Yorna: [I, must spend the rest of my life proving that.]

Eugard: [‘Tis a great service.]

Towards Iris=Yorna’s determined answer, Eugard responded with a smile.

Towards Eugard who dared not say too much, Iris=Yorna narrowed her eyes a little, and extended her arm so that she could touch his cheek, as she brought her lips close to his.

Yorna: [――――]

Lips met each other and overlapped, as those who had both died in that era, a man and a woman who by all rights should never have been able to reunite, separated by entire worlds, were now at the closest they had ever been.

Eugard: [――――]

Like that, the closest contact that they had made in this world for a moment, a single instant, persisted a moment longer, before the distance between them slowly grew―― Iris=Yorna, Eugard, their eyes met.

Then――,

Eugard: [Mine Star, I love you.]

Yorna: [Me too, Your Excellency. Forever, without ever fading, I will adore you.]

They exchanged a kiss, delivered each other words of love, and for the last time his lips curled into a model of a smile.

For the story of Iris and the King of Thorns, a story that began in the age of antiquity, a story that had kept postponing its own end until the present day, this was the true curtain’s close.

△▼△▼△▼△

――Dawn broke upon the first night since the Great Disaster that had shaken the entity of the Vollachian Empire had come to a conclusion.

The threat of undead wreaking havoc across the Empire had been averted by means of the unity of imperial subjects, devoting themselves to the law of iron and blood; at the forefront of those Sword Wolves of Vollachia, was the majestic figure of their apex, Vincent Vollachia, who  exchanged blows directly against the enemy ringleader with Yang Sword raised aloft. 

Centered around the Imperial Capital of Lupugana, the damages had reached to every major city of Vollachia, such as the Fortified City of Garkla and the City of Iron and Blood of Glarasia, the Demon City of Chaosflame and the Cloud Sea City of Mezoreia; yet, each and every city had been able to avoid falling into a catastrophic state.

Therefore, whilst left with major scars, it was ultimately a triumphant momentum that enveloped the Vollachian Empire.

Of course, thinking in the long term, the top brass could not bask in the victory forever. Those leading figures would have to deal with the damage reports of various locations flooding in one after another, as well as the numerous circumstances of their subjects that they would need to sanction, and thus they would not have the time to sleep.

Amidst those reports, there was a piece of information that had been silently snuck in.

In the battle against the Great Disaster, having contributed greatly to the victory of the Vollachian Empire, an obituary of the lone woman who had lived like a flame and captivated many――.

Within a room of the Fortified City of Garkla, which was serving as temporary headquarters in place of the ravaged Imperial Capital, Emperor Vincent Vollachia happened to catch wind of that obituary, creating a silence so very unlike himself, who would respond to all matters within an instant of deliberation, and after spending some time with his head down――,

Vincent: [――I see.]

Those brief words, were all that he spoke.

△▼△▼△▼△

The fight against the Great Disaster had ended, and people began to move on to reclaim their lives.

Vollachia suffered terrible devastation from the <u>undead</u> army during the unprecedented Great Disaster, but the people living within its borders have shown their resilience, standing up one by one to rebuild their land.

The sight of the people of the Empire simply overwhelmed Petra Leyte.

Petra: [Although, I don't really like the Empire much…]

Having said that, with mixed feelings, Petra stood in the streets of Fortified City.

A significant part of Petra's reason for not liking the Empire was anger that this was the place where her precious camp members and Petra’s love interest, Natsuki Subaru, were forcibly taken away from her.

Even after removing these presuppositions, Petra's feeling for Vollachia still leans toward dislike, but regardless, they cooperated and made an immense effort to prevent the country’s destruction.

Petra was also relieved that the Great Disaster had been overcome and the Empire was spared from destruction.

However, even so――,

Petra: [――Subaru.]

Petra, who in public addressed him with the honorific "Sama", was doubtless concerned for the man who had done more for the Empire than anyone else, even the Emperor.

Petra was extremely worried about how much it must have worn his heart down in an Empire full of terrible things because Subaru was such a kind and compassionate person.

Even so, the final nail in the coffin was too much for Subaru, who had so many things to worry about.

Petra: [Priscilla Barielle-sama…]

That was the name of the woman who had caused a tremendous, deep, and painful wound in Subaru's heart.

Due to Petra's position, she never exchanged a single word with her. However, there were opportunities. Before the Great Disaster, she was on the same side of the battle for the Imperial Capital and had ample opportunity to talk with her.

However, Petra did not dare to approach Priscilla.

This was because she, like Emilia, was a candidate for the Royal Selection in the Kingdom of Lugunica, and she felt that she should not get more comfortable than necessary with their opponents.

And Petra regretted that.

By not having interacted with Priscilla, Petra had no right to mourn the death of ――Priscilla Barielle, and therefore, found it difficult to sympathize with Subaru and Emilia.

It would be hard to tell two very heartbroken people that she understood what they were going through.

This was currently something tremendously frustrating for Petra――.

???: [――Hello, hello, Miss Petra, are you alone?]

Petra: [Oh, Zikr-san.]

Petra, who had been pursing her lips and tensing her cheeks, looked up at the call, and there was Zikr Osman with a round, voluptuous hairdo.

As a General of the Empire, Zikr played an important role in the battle against the Great Disaster, and he is a very likable person who treated Petra as a human being without being arrogant about his position.

Because of his diligence, Zikr would likely be heavily relied upon after the war, but it was unusual for him to be alone in a place like this. At this, Petra's eyes widened,

Zikr: [I've finished reorganizing all the troops, so I have finally come down to check the damage myself. I had heard the reports, but I had to see it firsthand.]

Petra: [I see, that was it. I do not know the details of the reorganization… but well done.]

Zikr: [Thank you for your thoughtfulness. However, the role I was able to play is insignificant compared to those who are working so energetically, such as General First-Class Goz and General First-Class Kafma.]

Petra: [I don’t think that you can say that your hard work is not important because one of you worked harder than the other.]

Zikr, looking embarrassed, became even more so from Petra's statement.

On the other hand, Petra reflected on her own remarks, remembering that when she had worried about Subaru earlier, she had compared his efforts to those of another―― a stern-eyed Emperor.

She wanted to see things the same way as the people she liked, but she was frustrated with herself for not being able to.

Petra: [But it is difficult for those of the General First-Class, isn't it? Not even a few days have passed since then, and you have to fly around to other cities.]

Zikr: [Yes. The Generals of the various regions are responding, but the influence of a General First-Class directly in front of them cannot be ignored. Both in terms of the morale of the troops and in terms of the stares they get.]

Petra: [I understand that the soldiers will be happy to see the people they admire, but staring is…]

Zikr: [Sadly, even in these situations… no, it is because of the impoverished situation that many are willing to take advantage of it to achieve immediate gain or to fulfill their ambitions.]

Petra: [――――]

Zikr lowered his eyebrows, and Petra's round eyes went downcast in response.

Petra was actually convinced by Zikr's reply, thinking to herself, "I knew as much."

The Vollachian Empire chose to stand together against a great enemy. Still, once the Great Disaster had been eliminated, the problem reverted from the perspective of the nation to the perspective of the individual. They take what they lack, steal it, and, in some cases, try to force their way through it all.

Those General First-Class named by Zikr intended to serve as a deterrent to such problems.

Zikr: [General First-Class Goz left as soon as his wife at Imperial Capital was confirmed to be safe, and General First-Class Kafma also left as soon as he received his promotion to General First-Class.]

Petra: [That was great, right?' Everyone was so surprised.]

Zikr: [There are only nine slots for General First-Class in the Empire, and the recent war has left several of those slots vacant… The creation of new General First-Class is one of the few good things to come out of this. Kafma understood this and accepted the position of General First-Class, which he had previously turned down.]

Petra: [Zikr-san, you have never talked about that, right?]

Zikr: [I have not?]

Petra tilted her head and asked Zikr, who praised the names of the General First-Class and their way of doing things.

Petra did not observe the battle up close, so she did not know how those of the General First-Class performed. However, Zikr's fighting spirit was also quite impressive in the sense that Petra was able to see them up close and personal.

During the battle for the Fortified City, there were those who were in the command post, observing the broad scope of the battle and directing it, and there were those who continued to clash with the undead with swords in their hands. Zikr's role was to bridge the gap between the two, and to ensure that they worked together seamlessly.

Although unassuming, without their work, the cohesiveness would fray and possibly crumble.

Petra: [I think even more so since my Nee-samas and I were behind the scenes as part of the group of healers.]

Zikr: […That is much appreciated recognition, Miss Petra. Just those words coming from a woman, I, Zikr Osman, feel deeply rewarded.]

Petra: [I am not saying that lightly…]

Zikr: [Of course, understood. But I do mean it, too.]

Zikr nodded his head as Petra tried to push back, feeling that she had been ignored. Then he turned his round eyes to the view of the city and relaxed his cheeks.

Zikr: [If there is such a thing as a reward, this sight, this result, is it. His Excellency the Emperor fled to the East, and I happened to be in Fortress City on a mission. Thanks to this coincidence, I had the honor of accompanying His Excellency and being present at this moment. I am undeniably blessed.]

Petra: […I am not sure, you deserve more praise, Zikr-san.]

Zikr: [Do you not understand, Miss Petra? In that case, can you think of someone more desirable to that brilliant mind of yours?]

Petra gave an "huh" at the abrupt suggestion. In her mind, all she could vaguely recall was Natsuki Subaru, who had occupied a large part of her mind until a few minutes ago.

Zikr nodded deeply in response to Petra, who unintentionally did as he said.

Zikr: [That desirable someone will smile at you as a result of your deeds. Isn't that enough to make you feel rewarded?]

Petra: [That is… well, yes.]

Zikr: [It's the same thing. I am a General of the Vollachian Empire, the extent to which Miss Petra has someone in mind is probably greater in my opinion. So, that is fine.]

Zikr said, with one eye closed and his hand clutched to his chest, and smiled at Petra. He was neither unreasonable nor trying to deceive Petra when he said that.

That was why Petra also quietly lowered her head and could not say anything――,

???: [――However, His Excellency Vincent is all for reward and punishment according to merit. I disapprove of a person having done such meritorious service by being so selfless, it makes it difficult for the soldiers to express their opinions.]

Then, instead of Petra, who had closed her mouth, a voice interrupted from a different direction. Petra and Zikr turned their heads to see Serena walking slowly toward them.

Serena Dracroy, with a distinctive white scar on her cheek that nevertheless did not detract from her dignified beauty, was accompanied by her acquaintance Roswaal next to her, who made Petra's lips curl.

Serena and the others did not miss that, flagrant response from Petra.

Serena: [As usual, how can you be so disliked by someone who could be old enough to be your daughter? You cannot complain about being stabbed in the back by someone who goes out of their way to be rebellious against you.]

Roswaal: [I would never hire a child who can't think about the consequences of their actiooo~ns. Regardless of your perception of me, I only employ competent people like Petra-kun, Otto-kun, and the like.]

Serena: [That's a bad habit you have. Eventually, that's going to be the reason you're going to get your feet swept out from under you.]

Serena shrugged her shoulders and had a casual exchange with Roswaal, her caustic words were mercilessly critical of Roswaal, which, from Petra's point of view, was a little enjoyable to listen to.

But the truth is that she did not really feel that small pleasantness at the moment.

Zikr: [High Countess Dracroy, I thought you were busy…]

Serena: [The same could be said of you, General. Don't worry. Although it is true that I haven't slept for the past three days, my eyes are still clear. I can't sleep.]

Zikr: [That does not sound like a reassuring statement…]

Serena smiled fearlessly at Zikr, and Zikr's shoulders contracted like he was afraid of her. Roswaal's gaze turned to Petra as those two exchanged a few words.

Petra, who had consciously avoided contact with him, stiffened slightly at his gaze,

Petra: [Wh-what is it, Master?]

Roswaal: [Don't be so wary, I'm <u>simply</u> concerned that you’re alone and that you’re working too much. Where is Frederica?]

Petra: […Frederica nee-sama has been keeping herself very busy for a long time and is now taking a break. After many requests, she finally took a break.]

It reminded her that Frederica was barely breathing and sleeping as if in a coma.

Frederica, like Petra, worked as one of the healers, but also went around the fortress as a messenger, transforming herself into a beast when necessary. Her tireless work ethic was something to be respected, but as her protegee, she could not help but feel worried.

The fact that she was resting now was not because she listened to Petra's appeal, but because Ram and Garfiel pushed her to do so.

Petra: [I couldn't even convince Frederica-neesama to rest.]

Roswaal: [Frederica has a strong sense of responsibiliii~ty. By no means did she mean any disrespect to you, Petra-kun.]

Petra: [――Hk, I know that already, you don't have to tell me that.]

Roswaal: [I see. You're right. I'm sorry I said something I shouldn't have. ――Are you okay?]

Petra: […The Yang Magic is working properly.]

Petra answered Roswaal's subtly dodging response with a frown.

Petra's magical techniques, which she learned from Roswaal and is now developing day by day, are suited to the Yang attribute, which has many effects that increase the power and vitality of the target.

In Petra's case, she was still uneasy about using it on others, but she could still use her yang magic on herself and be adequate enough to compensate for her lack of strength or lack of sleep. Of course, stamina is not an endless source of energy, so eventually, one's limits will emerge.

Petra: [Right now, I would like to work a little bit more. Do you wish to stop me?]

Roswaal: [――. No, I won't stop you. We all have opportunities in life when we have to overcome reason and common sense with passion and force, and if this is the time for you, Petra-kun, I'm not going to take that away from you.]

Petra: […I still don't like you, Master.]

Petra turned her face away from Roswaal, who closed one eye and looked at her with his blue one.

Despite being an unforgivable person, Roswaal often affirmed Petra's ideas in this way. It was not just to curry favor with Petra, but rather, it was his actual beliefs that made him say these words.

It was as if Petra could understand Roswaal's true nature.

Serena: [What a troublesome master-servant relationship. The way such things are, the Empire and the Kingdom aren’t so different. Don't you think so, General Second-Class Zikr?]

Zikr: [With Miss Petra being so intelligent at her age, it is not surprising that she is so enthusiastic about Margrave Mathers's education. When sincerity meets sincerity, I think a clash is inevitable. Of course, I think such a harsh way of life has also honed the beauty of High Countess Dracroy.]

Serena: [Good grief, you're an Imperial general through and through. I thought you were a decent man, but instead, you're like this. You are pleasing me by showing me a face I like so much.]

While Petra and Roswaal talked, Zikr reverently bowed to Serena's comments.

Petra sighed as she watched the conversation between two of the Empire's most unique temperaments. ――Roswaal's nature, whatever it may be, was unimportant. Now that she is face to face with Roswaal, whom she has been avoiding, there was no stopping now.

To which Petra tightened her cheeks and looked up at Roswaal,

Petra: [What are you planning to do with Subaru, Master?]

Roswaal: [Hmm.]

Petra: [Please answer.]

Petra's question was straightforward but lacking in specificity.

Roswaal let out a small sigh as it was directed at him. He closed one eye again, and, this time, looked at Petra with the yellow one ――this time with an inhuman look that Petra disliked.

――The unnaturalness of Subaru and Roswaal's relationship gave Petra a strong impression.

Petra suspected that this was something different from the indiscretions of Roswaal in Arlam village, Petra's hometown, or the Sanctuary where Frederica and Garfiel were from ――something that Subaru and the others had almost entirely tolerated.

If we look at Roswaal's misdeeds and who pardoned him, the conditions were the same for Subaru, Emilia, and Frederica, who were too forgiving. Then there was Beatrice and Garfiel, who said they were angry, followed by Ram, who was in a particular position, and Petra and Otto, who clearly did not forgive Roswaal.

Naturally, Petra and Otto always felt tension when dealing with Roswaal. Of course, they did not want to make waves, so the tension was like quietly roasting over a flame. What she disliked about Roswaal was that he never changed his expression while being roasted in such a way.

However, the blue flames that Petra and Otto directed toward Roswaal and the heat in the air between Subaru and Roswaal seemed fundamentally different.

It was a terrible way of putting it, Petra did not want to admit it. But she was convinced.

Subaru and Roswaal shared a secret that neither Petra nor anyone else could pry into. That shared secret caused a different kind of tension.

Furthermore, the consequences of that secret had surely, most likely, cause Subaru some unhappiness.

Roswaal: [What do you intend to do with Subaru-kunnn~?]

At Petra's hostile look, Roswaal muttered in a slightly gravelly voice.

There was not the usual atmosphere of deception or mockery. However, even without such a clownish atmosphere, one could not trust Roswaal.
 
As if to confirm Petra's sentiment, Roswaal closed one eye and said,

Roswaal: [Petra-kun, what do you think is the correct thing for me to dooo~?]

Petra: […Are you making fun of me?]

Roswaal: [No, that isn’t it, I didn't mean it that way. In fact, I'm just trying to figure out…how I should act towards Subaru-kun now.]

Petra: [――――]

As he said this, Roswaal lightly lifted both hands and lit his fingertips with different colored lights. He floated red in his right hand and blue in his left, thoughtfully considering his next move.

Petra was unsure which direction the red or the blue would take ――whether it would be good for Petra or for the people Petra cared for.

Despite not being sure, if there is one thing that Petra can do, it is this one thing.

Petra: [If,]

Roswaal: [huh?]

Petra: [If you cause Subaru any more pain or grief, I will never forgive you, Master….No, I will absolutely make you regret it.]

Not forgiving him would not hurt Roswaal in any way. After serving him for a year and a half, she already understood that.

This was why, thinking back to the past year and a half with everything she could think of, Petra said the one thing Roswaal would hate the most.

Yes, something he will regret no matter what. For that reason――,

Petra: [Whatever it is you are planning to do, whatever you want to do , Master, I'm going to get in the way of it.]

Roswaal: [――――]

For a moment, there was silence between Petra and Roswaal.

Petra put all her strength into tensing her cheeks and thought she had made the sternest face she had ever made in the history of her adorable self. In response to Petra's direct approach, Roswaal fell silent.

It was unclear how much Petra's stern face contributed to that pause for contemplation.

Roswaal: […That would certainly be troubling. You seem to be much more loved than I am.]

Petra: […What do you mean by loved?]

Roswaal: [It's a strange power that I've resolved myself to resist, and I've never been able to prevail against it.]

Roswaal shrugged his shoulders and said something again that Petra did not understand. But what came across his face as he muttered this did not make Petra think it was mere nonsense.

Indeed, Roswaal was dealing with a sense of powerlessness, something that he was acutely aware that he could not win. It did not feel right to Petra to be told that she was loved as such.

Petra merely wanted to be loved by the people she loved.

In addition, all she desired was for her loved ones to be as happy and smiling as possible.

That was why――,

Petra: [I want Emilia-neesama and Subaru to smile.]

Petra put her hands tightly on her chest and muttered those words as if she was praying.

She sincerely hoped that all of these prayers would hang like clouds over those she loved and would protect them from the difficult things that would come down on them like sunlight.

――While they watched the tense atmosphere between master and servant, Petra and Roswaal, Serena smiled at Zikr, as they watched.

Serena: [What do you think? The people of the kingdom are quite a sight to behold, aren't they? Quite complex and mysterious, just the way I like them.]

Zikr: […The High Countess' smile is beautiful, but I cannot say it is in good taste.]
