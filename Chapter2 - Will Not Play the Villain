*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

???: [Kakakakka! Never would’ve I thought that a fella like me’d die not on the battlefield but in a safe zone. Never in all my life have I heard of a shinobi dyin’ like this, but ain’t it just way too ironic.]

So said the monstrous old man, swinging both of his empty sleeves as he laughed uproariously.

While he heard that hearty laughter, unable to make use of his healing magic, Garfiel felt mixed emotions.

――After the battle of the “Great Disaster”, Garfiel joined the healers, and was now treating the injured. 

Since arriving in the Empire, without much rest, Garfiel had continued to fight a fierce battle. Of course, he had been told by his allies that he should rest, but he hadn’t listened to them.

Fortunately, Garfiel’s body was sturdy, and because of the Divine Protection of Earth Spirits, standing on the ground was the best form of relaxation for him. Of everyone within Emilia’s camp, Garfiel was far from being worked to death. Although it goes without saying, Otto was the closest to being worked to death.

Anyways――,

Ram: [No matter what is said to you, it’s pointless once you have decided to do something. If that’s the case, rather than forcibly giving to the Empire, sell them gratitude. This is a good time to sell appreciation.]

While everyone was against Garfiel’s idea, he was glad to have one clear, cherished ally. He liked the way she laid out the faults, it was so like her.

For that reason, though his allies were also shocked, he took up this position. Ultimately, no one tried to stop him, as they all understood.

Garfiel: [ How can our amazin’ selves be so flustered when the eighth strongest is like that.]

Grumbling that, Garfiel bit his sharp canine.

They’d lost a strong, truly strong woman. Although he couldn’t say they fought the same enemy side by side, the sight of many dazzling flames rising up within the capital had been seared into Garfiel’s eyelids.

That feeling could not simply be described as one of loss for Emilia’s rival.

That was why, Garfiel decided for certain.

He would protect as many people from being lost as possible. He’d mercilessly smash the undead, sometimes even eradicating whatever enemies stood in his allies’ way with his own hands, all just to narrowly prevent any more death.

It was contradicting. But, contradicting was fine. Without thinking of anything too difficult, he followed his heart’s desire.

To his heart’s content, he would fell his enemies, heal his allies, and save people with his own power.

If Garfiel could save as many people as he could even in his sleep, he would cotninue to do so.

Olbart: [...Good grief, the nerve of young’uns to immediately leave the elderly behind. I can’t help but be revolted.]

Garfiel: [ Oi, you’re being sarcastic, huh, gramps. Just because my amazin’ self can’t heal your arms…]

Olbart: [ Ka-ka-kka! This ain’t sarcasm. For years I’ve been sayin’ that envy and jealousy are the source of my strength. I ain’t lyin’ when I say I’m envious. Ah, I’m green with envy.]

Wagging his white eyebrows up and down, Olbart skillfully used his leg to scratch his neck.

He didn’t seem particularly inconvenienced by the loss of both arms, and one could not tell whether he was concerned for Garfiel, who could not extend his healing magic to him, or if he was just teasing. 

At any rate, even without his arm, the old man was a monster, since he could already move so much despite being almost half-dead.

Although, if one were to speak about surviving a near death experience――,

???: [――Shut up you old fuck! I'm fucking tired, and you're fucking with the guy who's doing all the fucking work.]

Olbart: [Oh, scary scary. That isn’t the vigor of someone who’s half dead.]

A figure laid on a bed further in the back shouted angrily, and Olbart laughed at that in a low, purring way. To that fierce vigor Garfiel scratched and said “Oi”,

Garfiel: [ My amazin’ self is happy for the backup, but worry about yer own self first. You’re seriously one step from death, it’s like you’re “Paying tribute to Viviroro”.]

???: [Huh? I'm telling you, you fucking saved me! You don't fucking take my thanks and then start fucking talking about…gyaow!]

Garfiel: [Shut up, go to sleep!]

He pushed down on the head of a short figure, who used his entire body to scream as he toppled over. The wound was so severe that, even if he were to continuously use the full strength of his healing magic, he would be unable to keep up with the damage.

In fact, even now there was a constant surging pain that ripped through his body.

Garfiel: [I can’t speak for my amazin’ self, but I’m surprised you're still awake and talkin’]

???: [It fuckin’ hurts like shit and I’m sufferin’, but that bullshit won’t fuckin’ stop Groovy Gumlet-sama. That’s how it is, so use some fuckin’ poison or medicine or some shit to quell… Guoooo…!]

Olbart: [Just give up already, give up. So, this is the result of ya ignoring all of tha signals in yer body. I lost both my hands an’ you’re basically as close to death as me. Why don’tcha just retire?]

Groovy: [I will, you stupid fuck!]

Towards Olbart’s mockery, Groovy Gumlet bared his fangs and shouted at him—— One of the Nine Divine Generals, and probably the one who came closest to the brink of death in the Empire whilst still surviving.

In the life-or-death struggle of the Great Disaster, the role he played was enormous. After all, it was he who crossed swords against the protagonist of Iris and the King of Thorns, the Emperor of the Briar Eugard Vollachia, and it was he who cooperated with Halibel to move the curse onto himself and thus became a key part of their victory.

Garfiel: [If ya hadn’t done that, everyone was sayin’ that we’d have been stuck with the thorns.]

Groovy: [I just pulled out whatever shit I could. After I saw off the Emperor of the Briar and the Admirer, I just had to fuckin’ lie down until I could give the fuckin’ Fiend Sword to that dickhead Cecilus.]

Groovy muttered as if he were sulking, but before he had fallen he had put in a lot of work.

He had taken Eugard’s curse into his own body, and then had allowed the Fiend Sword to cut him down; no matter how many times Garfiel heard the story he still couldn’t understand it. However, according to Groovy, he didn’t understand Garfiel’s fight against the Cloud Dragon, so they were the same in that regard. 

The strongest amongst people and a piling up of miracles, at that time in the Imperial Capital—— No, across the entirety of the Empire this was the reality of what had occurred. The fight between the Cloud Dragon and Garfiel, Groovy who saved the Emperor of the Briar from his own thorns, and Olbart who sacrificed his other arm to prevent the schemes of the Witch, all of them had exerted their utmost.

There was no need to exaggerate their achievements, and there was no need to rail against the facts. 

Olbart: [Well, as a geezer with hardly any time left, it’s always sad to see young’uns dyin’ one after the other, so it’s been this old man’s pleasure to see ya fellas survive.]

Groovy: [...I dunno about me, but I think it’s pretty fuckin’ doubtful that you can say that guy survived.]

Garfiel: [That guy…]

Thinking about the topic that he had raised, Garfiel’s gaze moved towards the end of the healing room. There, standing in a strange and conspicuous way, he noticed the characteristic upright stance of something.

While everything was still frenetic, in a corner where people ran back and forth in the healing room for the sake of the injured, it was unable to prevent itself from becoming an obstacle as it assimilated with the wall in order to continue standing, an existence whose body was made of steel—— Upon noticing Garfiel’s gaze, a jewel that was set into what appeared to be its head flashed green.

Steelman: [I, have noticed other’s gaze. Task, directive, or instruction, it is predicted to be one of these.]

While it spoke, it lumbered over to Garfiel and the others, the one amongst the Nine Divine Generals who was known as The Steelman, Moguro Hagane.

Of course, although it was correct to say that it was distinct from the Steelman tribe, it was more correct to call it the Meteor that acted as the core of the Crystal Palace. This title, after the collapse of the Crystal Palace and Magic Crystal Cannon, no longer held any meaning, but—— 

Garfiel: [Ah, sorry ‘bout that. My eyes just wander there sometimes, I don’t have any tasks for ya.]

Moguro: [Acknowledged. The others, those two?]

Groovy: [Nothin’. Stay out of the fuckin’ way, go around there, Moguro.]

Moguro: [Moguro. That is me. Acknowledged. Instructions, wait again.]

While Garfiel stood beside him with an awkward expression on his face, Groovy said this while motioning with his chin, which Moguro obediently followed, sitting down at the side of the bed.

In doing so, it appeared like a slightly oversized ornament.

Olbart: [He looks like a properly trained ground dragon or thunder wolf. But, that’s all. Even the Crystal Palace can be forgetful.]

Groovy: [The Crystal Palace and Magic Crystal Cannon are fuckin’ blown to shit. It’s a fuckin’ miracle that there isn’t shit-all left of Moguro’s core. It’s also too much of a fuckin’ coincidence that it happened to fall near where I was layin’ down.]

Olbart: [Ya were his closest friend, so maybe he came to meetcha?]

Olbart cackled with laughter as he cracked jokes, to which Groovy snorted his snout in discontent.

As made apparent by their dialogue, Moguro Hagane did not remember anything from before the Great Disaster. If Subaru were to be asked, he would say this seemed like a “factory reset”, as it seemed like everything that this Meteor had acquired as Moguro Hagane had been erased.

An immense power capable of blowing away the entirety of the Imperial Capital was forcibly raised into the sky to prevent such an outcome, and had detonated without engulfing the area, so it could perhaps be said that this was a minor price to pay.

Garfiel: [How could I ever say somethin’ like that after what happened to Rem.]

Just how much of a weight was carried in someone losing all of their Memories up to that point, was something that Garfiel was keenly aware of due to the circumstances of one of their own.

It was not only a great turmoil to the actual person who had lost their Memories, but also to the people around them who they had forgotten.

That was why, he understood the feeling―― he would not say such thoughtless things though.

Garfiel: [Surprisingly, the things this geezer’s sayin’ might actually be right.]

Groovy: [Hahh? Are you also fucking mocking me with that load of fucking horseshit.]

Garfiel: [That ain’t it. I mean, it may be true that they don’t remember anything. But ain’t it also right that they’re not doin’ anything like tryna flee from you?]

Saying that, Garfiel narrowed his eyes at Moguro, who was sitting next to the bed.

To be honest, that large frame sitting in the healing room was an obstruction, but the fact that they were making themselves as compact as possible to avoid causing trouble to their surroundings left a sense of good will.

To begin with, the fact that Moguro went to such lengths to remain here, was likely because they did not want to part from Groovy’s side.

Having lost their Memories, it might have just been something like imprinting onto the first person they encountered. But, Rem said that when she and Ram finally reunited in this Empire, she intuited that Ram was her older sister through a strange feeling.

Garfiel thought maybe that same “something” also remained within Moguro.

Garfiel: [Well, Captain also said something ‘bout Rem breaking his finger all of a sudden…]

There were also cases when that “something” did not remain, so it could not be said to be an absolute rule. But, since this was the healing room where people were healed, if Moguro had come here all on their own to heal their own heart in a place nobody knew about, then Garfiel had no reason to kick them out.

Garfiel: [Rather, the old geezer who does nothin’ but talk without even the hands to spare is more of an obstruction.]

Olbart: [Kakakakka! Really talkin’ like that ta me, this young’un! Well, I do get what yer sayin’.]

As Garfiel shrugged his shoulders, Olbart waved his two sleeves about while laughing. Outside that exchange, Groovy rubbed his black snout, and looked at Moguro.

He looked at his former comrade in arms, who was simply nestling close to him without even the slightest of movements.

Groovy: [Don’t do such fucking sentimental things, fucking hell.]

Moguro: [Within statement, sound of liquid detected. In fear of unusual circumstances, requesting instructions…]

Groovy: [Fucking shut the fuck up!]

Moguro: [Understood.]

Hearing that fruitless exchange, Garfiel gnashed his fangs and unconsciously smiled.

Since he was smiling, he worried a little bit over if it was okay to smile, and then he smiled broadly to his heart's desire.

△▼△▼△▼△

Otto: [――So, Anastasia-sama will return to Lugunica via Kararagi?]

Anastasia: [Yes, that's the plan. I'm in the empire as an envoy from Kararagi, y’know. I know it's just a title, but I gotta do my duty.]

When Anastasia, smiling softly, openly revealed her inner thoughts to Otto, he accepted it with a quiet and casual "I see" on the surface.

However, his inner thoughts were not as carefree as his expression. ――Whatever the case, Anastasia had fulfilled her promised role for the Kararagi City-States. This would boost her reputation with the Kararagi Council, which sent her there, and Anastasia would receive another solid boost in her bid for the crown.

Of course, Emilia also contributed greatly to the fight against the Great Disaster when the Vollachian Empire was on the verge of collapse, and His Excellency the Emperor Vincent directly requested her assistance.

Although they were smuggled into the country when they entered the Empire, they would be able to return home triumphant and proud.

Still, whether it was the battle against the Witch Cult in Pristella, the capture of the Pleiades Watchtower, or even the rescue of the Vollachian Empire, both the Emilia camp and Anastasia camp had been involved. ——Anastasia shared in all the prestige Emilia had earned, but Emilia’s reputation hadn’t been on-par with hers from the start.

Of course, had it not been for their part in the fight against the Great Disaster that struck the Empire this time, the camp would have been far behind, even more so than it is now.

Anastasia: [There's a mountain of things to think ‘bout, it must be tough for Otto-kun, eh?]

That momentary silence was pierced by Anastasia's light blue eyes.

Despite being an approximate guess, this question had a certainty to it, thanks to Anastasia's seasoned experience.

 In response to her prodding, Otto smiled back and said, "No."

Otto: [It's true that it's a bit daunting, but if we were to talk in terms of having much to think about, there is no comparison to His Excellency the Emperor or to Prime Minister Berstetz, who need to rebuild the empire from this point forth.]

With that, Otto shifted the subject to someone else present ―― Berstetz, the Imperial Prime Minister.

In the conference room where Anastasia, Berstetz, and Otto met after finishing the battle against the Great Disaster, they discussed the future plans of Vollachia, which was now putting together a project for recovery and revitalization, and of the people who had been cooperating with them.

Amidst all this, Otto directed the waters to Berstetz, who concealed deep colors within his threadbare eyes as he spoke,

Berstetz: [As you say, there are many challenges ahead. But the truth is, I don't think of it as a burden.]

Anastasia: [Oh, really? That's awfully encouragin’.]

Berstetz: [In the beginning, I was a treacherous subject who colluded with the White Spider Chisha Gold to jeopardize the position of His Excellency the Emperor. Because of the circumstances, I was not executed during the battle against the Great Disaster, but I was still to be executed after the war.]

Otto: […but you are talking to us like this. There was no such action, correct?]

Berstetz: [Yes. The Emperor has so decided. Of course, should any of them have thought that I could not be pardoned, I would have had no choice but to take that blade into my body…]

Otto could guess what Berstetz was thinking when he broke off his speech. It was probably the biggest reason why Berstetz's head was still connected to his neck―― the declaration made after the war by the strongest man in the empire, the Blue Lightning.

Cecilus: [Before anyone gets bloodthirsty, I would like to declare that it is His Excellency's decision not to kill Berstetz-San, so you all should follow it. If you go against it, I will have to show my sword-like side for the first time in a while. Besides, I have a vague feeling that Chisha had planned to the extent that His Excellency would not kill Berstetz-San. In fact, without Berstetz-San, it will be hard to go on without Chisha, won't it? And Chisha isn't here.]

It was too long and drawn-out a statement to be called a declaration, but it was a significant factor in dissuading those who knew of Berstetz's deeds.

Berstetz, apparently thinking the same thing, made a slight smile as he said,

Berstetz: [I never thought I would be protected by General First-Class Cecilus Segmunt. If not the Yang Sword, I would have thought his blade to be the one to decapitate me.]

Otto: [And yet it did not. It's an imperial situation, so an outsider cannot comment on it, however I consider it to have been a wise decision. A military officer in an emergency and a civilian officer before and after an emergency, such a person is irreplaceable.]

Anastasia: [I agree. If even Berstetz-san was removed and the emperor was the only one who could do the thinking, wouldn't he die, even with the support of his lovely Wife-San?]

Berstetz: [Indeed, it is so. I, for one, am glad to see His Excellency receive a new queen. ――If it were not for this celebration, His Excellency would be facing too many hardships.]

Both: [――]

Shaking his head loosely, silence fell over the room as Berstetz spilled those words.

In the midst of the silence, Otto turned his attention toward Anastasia. She, too, was feeling the weight of the same silence, though likely in a different perspective from Otto’s.  

The reason for this silence, needless to say, was the tragic events that had befallen Vincent―― the deaths of his trusted confidant and his sister, the princess whom he shared the same blood with.

The impact of the latter was something neither Otto nor Anastasia could ignore.

Anastasia: [Really, she was a selfish princess.]

A quiet murmur escaped Anastasia's lips, causing Otto to close his eyes.

The subtle sentiment felt like the rare crack in Anastasia, who usually had a bravery that remained unfazed in the face of any event.

It was this vulnerability that Otto had always wished to see in Anastasia in order to surpass her. ――Yet, that long-waited vulnerability, was released without the urge of exploiting.

If one were to ask why.

Otto: [Because it is not reproducible.]

The vulnerability revealed at this moment was not a convenient tool that could be used in the future. It was difficult to create the same opportunity again, and even if it could be, it should not be.

After all, a larger and deeper rift would open within his own circle than the one that had opened up within Anastasia.

Frankly speaking, that is also undesirable from Otto's perspective. Over the past few months, the distance between Emilia and Anastasia had narrowed too much.

???: [Maybe you don't need to consciously try to play the villain.]

Otto: [――. Are you perhaps talking to me?]

Suddenly, Otto reacted to a third person's voice, that was neither Anastasia nor Berstetz. His gaze was directed towards Anastasia's neck, where the voice came from―― the spirit in the guise of a fox scarf, Echidna, was looking at him with her black eyes.

In response to Otto’s words, Echidna slightly narrowed her eyes. 

Echidna: [The fact that you took it as a remark directed at yourself is a testament to what is  in your heart, is it not?]

Otto: [To say such things while looking at me is not really convincing.]

Echidna: [You are quite stubborn. A good match with Ana in that regard.]

Echidna, with a sulky tone, was being restrained by a slender finger placed on her fox’s head by Anastasia. She then looked at her scarf, which was tangled with Otto's.

Anastasia: [Don’t get all tangled up with Otto-kun like that. The moment ya were allowed to talk to anyone, ya turned into a chatterbox.]

Echidna: [Mhm, don’t imply it like I'm just opening my mouth out of personal desire. Certainly, from my current position, I have to acknowledge that my previous circumstances were restrictive.]

Anastasia: [Jeez. I’m sorry, Otto-kun, for letting my child get involved.]

Anastasia’s apology was met with a “no” and a dismissive wave from Otto.

The remark of Echidna was meant to assert her own presence rather than a word to show genuine concern for Otto. Of course, Echidna, being closest to Anastasia, was also aware of the rift in Anastasia that Otto had noticed.

A deterrent to prevent him from attacking. It was necessary as long as she could not see Otto's inner thoughts, whether would he intend to take advantage of that rift.

Nonetheless――,

Otto: [I don’t consider myself a villain. …If it were to be my role, it’s only because I’m playing it.]

In that sense, Echidna's remark was completely off the mark.

The news of Priscilla's death, which shook even Anastasia, and even more so the camp――Regarding this, Otto’s heart had remained unfazed that even he considered himself unsympathetic about it.

He had a few chances to exchange words with Priscilla, and even recognized that she was certainly a remarkable figure as a Royal Candidate. With that in mind, he felt so.

Otto: [It was entirely possible for a candidate to drop out in the midst of the Royal Selection.]

Naturally, he had not expected that she would lose her life in a battle for the survival of a neighboring country, but even when it came to the political strife involving one of the nation's most important affairs, there was more than enough possibility for an assassin to be sent to kill a Royal Candidate, and for them to fall victim to that assassin’s blade.

In the case of the Emilia Camp, there was a pattern where the person who sent the assassin was, to much surprise, one of their own, but even without such exceptions, this would hold true.

He did not believe that the Council of Wise Men, the current governing body of the Kingdom of Lugunica, would not have considered these circumstances in advance.

If a Royal Candidate went absent, would someone else fill the seat anew, or would the Royal Selection proceed with one of the five seats remaining vacant?

It was Otto’s honest opinion that the latter was of higher likelihood, and the option he would personally prefer.

Given that such a situation would be of great importance to the Kingdom――,

Otto: [The plan is for us to return to the Kingdom within the next few days. The Empire would not want people from other countries knowing any more about their internal condition following the Great Disaster, now would they?]

Anastasia: [Same goes for us. Since it’d also be strange for us to have our steps in sync, dependin’ on if we’ve gotten all our preparations in order, we might be leavin’ for Kararagi as soon as tomorrow. Otto-kun, as for the report to the castle…]

Otto: [Please leave it to us. This is not a matter that can be communicated by letter after all.]

Anastasia nodded and entrusted the role of reporting to the Royal Castle to his side.

Frankly, it was a daunting role, but also a critical duty at the same time. Of course, Otto would accompany Emilia in this, but it would likely be an exceedingly difficult role for her.

In times like these, it was supposed to be the duty of Emilia’s one and only Knight to support her the most.

Otto: […With Natsuki-san’s current state, it would likely have the opposite effect on Emilia-sama.]

Anastasia: […From the sound of it, Natsuki-kun's situation hasn't changed then?]

Otto: [Indeed. Knight Julius has also turned up a few times, but it has been difficult. I hate to say this, but there was the impression that Priscilla-sama only ever gave him a hard time…]

Anastasia: [As far as Natsuki-kun was concerned, that was unimportant. ――How worryin’.]

Anastasia's fingertips tickled Echidna's neck as she spoke in a quiet voice. Echidna's dark eyes also seemed to be worried about Subaru as she quivered at the touch.

There was an unalloyed sense of mutual affection between Anastasia and Echidna.

Berstetz: [I understand the opinion of the envoys of both the Kingdom and the City-States. His Excellency the Emperor has instructed that both nations be granted every courtesy, and has granted me permission to make decisions on the matter. If there is anything I can do…]

Anastasia: [Can’t say that I’ll be takin’ this lightly. There’s nothing more tense than bein’ presented with a blank promissory note.]

Anastasia gave a wry smile at Berstetz, who hid his emotions behind his thread-like eyes. Otto, who shared the same frame of mind, was eager to make the most of the words that had been drawn out.

This was his place in the Emilia Camp, not as a villain, but rather as one who undertook the “necessary evil”.

Because his nature was such, even if Priscilla had not died, he would have planned to use her origins in the Imperial Family as a basis to have her withdraw as an ineligible Royal Candidate, and he would have chosen to enact it.

Yes, he could have made that choice.

That was why――,

Otto: [――Even had you not died, you would not have become our enemy. As much as Natsuki-san and Emilia-sama are hurt by it, your death has… delivered me quite the hard blow.]

As someone from a different camp, with no reason to mourn and grieve her death, that was the least bit of condolence Otto Suwen could offer to the woman who had passed on.
